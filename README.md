# Learn Coding Self-Starter Guideline

## The BIG Idea
We want to challenge you to learn coding or understand the basics of programming for 3 months. We believe 3 months is a fair commitment. We'll be suggesting some materials based on some objectives we crafted. You can either use it as reference at your own pace or not. Above all, the key is _**practise**_.

We'd also like to hear your feedback if this guideline is useful, please drop us comments to our [Self-Starter Coder FB Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1243772295717833/).

## Who should find this useful?
-  You are curious to learn coding and don't know where to begin
-  You are not sure if coding is for you and willing to invest 3 months to find out once and for all
-  You have technical background and feels like it's time to pick up a new skill to advance your career
