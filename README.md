# Learn Coding Self-Starter Guideline

## The BIG Idea
We want to challenge you to learn coding or understand the basics of programming for 3 months. We believe 3 months is a fair commitment. We'll be suggesting some materials based on some objectives we crafted. You can either use it as reference at your own pace or not. Above all, the key is _**practise**_.

We'd also like to hear your feedback if this guideline is useful, please drop us comments to our [Self-Starter Coder FB Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1243772295717833/).

## Who should find this useful?
-  You are curious to learn coding and don't know where to begin
-  You are not sure if coding is for you and willing to invest 3 months to find out once and for all
-  You have technical background and feels like it's time to pick up a new skill to advance your career

## Suggested Material
### Objective: Create a To-Do List application at the end of this course.
< Content here >

### Objective: To understand the basics of Data Structure (DS).
#### For beginners
- [Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals] (https://goo.gl/Lll3H3) by Simon Allardice where you'll learn core ideas and essentials skills about programming. 

#### For those who want to get solid programming skills regardless of a programming language
- [Foundations of Programming: Code Efficiency] (https://goo.gl/m2rMVT) by Simon Allardice. Take this course if you want to learn how to make code run faster.
- [Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design] (https://goo.gl/VwNGpp) by Simon Allardice. This course helps you to design, understand and create a more complex application.
- [Foundations of Programming: Design Patterns] (https://goo.gl/ub95n3) by Elisabeth Robson and Eric Freeman. You'll learn solutions to common software design problems.
- [Foundations of Programming: Data Structures] (https://goo.gl/oAiP3k) by Simon Allardice. This course is about deeper understanding of data structures (dictionaries, sets, hash tables, queues and stacks, lists and link lists, trees and graphs and other multiple ways to contain information inside a computer program).
- [Foundations of Programming: Discrete Mathematics] (https://goo.gl/2jVal4) by Peggy Fisher where you'll learn how to use discrete mathematics in programming. 
- [Foundations of Programming: Databases] (https://goo.gl/Dguqi1) by Simon Allardice. This course covers essential database knowledge.

#### Python
-  [Why study DS] (http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhyStudyDataStructuresandAbstractDataTypes.html)
-  [Basic DS] (http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/toctree.html)

### Objective: Practise the new language with algorithm for at least 20 hours.
According to Josh Kaufman, "... with a little bit of of practise, you get really good, really quickly". He said that 20 hours of practise are sufficient to get you from beginner to intermediate level very quickly. If you are interested to hear more of his theory, listen to his inspiring talk on [TED Talk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY). 

There are some good sites with real algorithm interview questions you may start with. The neat part is, there are alot of submissions of answers from people which you may refer as well.

-  [Geeks for Geeks] (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

### Objective: Obtain a deeper appreciation of programming concepts/ideas.
#### History of computer science and its evolution. 
This [article] (https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/in-2017-learn-every-language-59b11f68eee#.hgvzy465k) talks about how you can learn any programming language if you can understand that all languages are essentially an abstraction to solve a specific problem. Hence, knowing the history of computer science is fundamental. Watch this lecture by [Ras Bodik] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjR7tQTIWbc&list=PL3A16CFC42CA6EF4F) - you may start from 42:07 onwards if you want to skip to the history portion.
